Coronavirus is icebreaker for online daters – but meeting has to wait</a></p>

<p class="quote">“One online dater, Pete, 34, said everyone now has an easy icebreaker: ‘I would say there is an easy opening chat subject at the moment. How are you surviving? Are you working from home? There is a good reason to start talking.’”</p>

<p>Dating app Tinder has reported that usage increases once an area is placed under more stringent social isolation restrictions, indicating that individuals are still looking for ways to connect. Some couples meeting online are even organizing dates via video calls. Though the long-term social ramifications of this event in the dating sphere are yet unknown, technology is clearly playing an even more essential role in dating than usual.</p>

<p class="quote">“‘A lot of people worry about a kiss at the end of the first date, like how does that work?’ Fraser said in a phone interview. ‘So it kind of felt good that I didn’t have to be nervous over that.’”</p>

<p>People turn to dating apps as in-person socialization becomes impossible due to social distancing. Some apps, like Coffee Meets Bagel, have even added a disclaimer encouraging daters to keep their dates online for now. Gen-Z-created OKZoomer launched on March 13 and was specifically created to help college students date in the time of social distancing. While some have found connection, others express feeling physically isolated despite the online contact.</p>

<p class="quote">“With social distancing a reality, and something that is being advised by the U.S. Department of Health, dating apps are newly dealing with a virus that has people across the country worried not only about dating, but day-to-day life.”</p>

<p>While some app users have expressed worry about online dating during this time, dating apps are giving advice to their users to attempt to halt the spread of coronavirus. Tinder offered tips on hand washing, carrying hand sanitizer, and maintaining social distance in public. Bumble has also announced that the health and safety of its community was a priority.</p>

<p class="quote">“OkCupid has also reported surging engagement and messaging among millennials. People are talking more through the app—and they are talking about coronavirus.”</p>

<p>Some dating apps are seeing their numbers surge, like Ship, which claimed that its chat messages increased by 60% in the past week, especially in Seattle and New York when social distancing measures were enforced. Many of these messages pertain to the coronavirus itself. OkCupid found that there was an 188% increase in coronavirus mentions on profiles in between January and February. Amsterdam-based Inner Circle has noticed a 30% increase in exchanged phone numbers and mentions of video calls and has promoted “self-isolate and chill.”</p>

<p class="quote">“The dates have been better than the ones in real life because we’re having to communicate more.”</p>

<p>Dating app usage is surging for some companies as cities and states announce shelter-in-place mandates—Bumble, particularly, is noticing an uptick. Bumble also recorded a 21% increase in video calls made in the last week. Match, the parent company of Tinder and several other dating apps, has launched a Dating While Distancing hotline that allows users to speak with dating experts. Tinder is offering its Passport feature for free this week until April 30.</p>

Around the world, dating finds a way</a></p>

<p class="quote">“There has been no meaningful change in the number of people downloading dating apps in the United States or globally, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower.”</p>

<p>While some dating apps are recording normal usage, others like OkCupid say they are seeing more younger users in larger cities. Some apps aren’t so lucky, though. Tinder, usually considered a hook-up app, noticed fewer installs when countries went into lockdown. These numbers were down 41% in Italy and 37% in Spain. Several apps, including Grindr and Tinder, have added health advisories to their products.</p>

<p class="quote">“You're clearly not going to be meeting anyone at a bar or striking up a conversation with your gym crush any time soon, so try your hand at online dating, whether it's Bumble, Coffee Meets Bagel, The League or Tinder — the apps are endless, download them all.”</p>

<p>Tips for dating during the coronavirus pandemic center around online instead of in-person dating. Creating a unique profile is key to getting swipes, and you can connect with your match via phone or video call. Some couples have opted to have a drink, cook, or even play a game together. Finding ways to show generosity to your date also goes a long way.</p>
